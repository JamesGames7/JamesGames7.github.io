            <p id="frontPageText">Hello! We are Connor and Ethan, two high school students with a dream to make literacy rates higher. These rates have been dropping more and more every year among young kids due to a number of factors. Our goal is to help parents who perhaps don’t have as much time to be involved or don’t have the means to get fun interactive tools for their kids. That is how storysprout was founded! It is a website and app with choose your own adventure stories and reading comprehension - so kids can enjoy reading. We are excited to see where the project can go in the future! To continue on this adventure, click on PlayAdventure above to see some great stories! Can you find all the endings?</p>
